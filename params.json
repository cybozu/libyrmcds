{"name":"libyrmcds","tagline":"A memcached client library for C/C++.  Best suited to yrmcds.","body":"libyrmcds is a [memcached][] client library written in C.  \r\nThis is a companion to [yrmcds][], a memcached compatible KVS.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the library itself, a client program called `yc` is included.\r\n\r\nFeatures\r\n--------\r\n\r\n* Minimalistic.\r\n\r\n    libyrmcds does *not* provide any rich features like consistent hashing.\r\n    Instead, it can be used as a base library to implement such rich\r\n    features.\r\n\r\n* Only the binary protocol is supported.\r\n\r\n    By supporting only the latest [binary protocol][binprot], libyrmcds\r\n    provides full access to the every aspect of the protocol.\r\n\r\n* Support for [yrmcds][] extensions.\r\n\r\n    Specifically, [the server-side locking][locking] and [the counter extension][counter] is supported.\r\n\r\n* Separated send / recv operations.\r\n\r\n    Although the socket used in libyrmcds is blocking, receiving results\r\n    from the server is separated from the sending operations.  You can\r\n    even use a different thread to receive results asynchronously.\r\n\r\n* Optional compression with [LZ4][].\r\n\r\n    Large objects can be transparently compressed/uncompressed with\r\n    [LZ4][] compression algorithm.\r\n\r\nLicense\r\n-------\r\n\r\nThis library is licensed under [the BSD 2-clause license][2bsd].\r\n\r\n[memcached]: http://memcached.org/\r\n[yrmcds]: http://cybozu.github.io/yrmcds/\r\n[binprot]: https://code.google.com/p/memcached/wiki/BinaryProtocolRevamped\r\n[locking]: https://github.com/cybozu/yrmcds/blob/master/docs/locking.md\r\n[counter]: https://github.com/cybozu/yrmcds/blob/master/docs/counter.md\r\n[LZ4]: https://code.google.com/p/lz4/\r\n[2bsd]: https://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-2-Clause","google":"UA-42201828-2","note":"Don't delete this file!

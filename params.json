  "body": "libyrmcds is a [memcached][] client library written in C.  \r\nThis is a companion to [yrmcds][], a memcached compatible KVS.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the library itself, a client program called `yc` is included.\r\n\r\nFeatures\r\n--------\r\n\r\n* Minimalistic.\r\n\r\n    libyrmcds does *not* provide any rich features like consistent hashing.\r\n    Instead, it can be used as a base library to implement such rich\r\n    features.\r\n\r\n* Designed for binary protocol.\r\n\r\n    In order to access the true power of the binary protocol, libyrmcds\r\n    is designed primarily for binary protocol.  Limited support for the\r\n    text protocol is provided, though.\r\n\r\n* Support for [yrmcds][] extensions.\r\n\r\n    Specifically, [the server-side locking][locking] and [the counter extension][counter] is supported.\r\n\r\n* Separated send / recv operations.\r\n\r\n    Although the socket used in libyrmcds is blocking, receiving results\r\n    from the server is separated from the sending operations.  You can\r\n    even use a different thread to receive results asynchronously.\r\n\r\n* Optional compression with [LZ4][].\r\n\r\n    Large objects can be transparently compressed/uncompressed with\r\n    [LZ4][] compression algorithm.\r\n\r\nDocuments\r\n---------\r\n\r\n* [Usage](https://github.com/cybozu/libyrmcds/blob/master/USAGE.md)\r\n* [API](html/)\r\n\r\nLicense\r\n-------\r\n\r\nThis library is licensed under [the BSD 2-clause license][2bsd].\r\n\r\n[memcached]: http://memcached.org/\r\n[yrmcds]: http://cybozu.github.io/yrmcds/\r\n[binprot]: https://code.google.com/p/memcached/wiki/BinaryProtocolRevamped\r\n[locking]: https://github.com/cybozu/yrmcds/blob/master/docs/locking.md\r\n[counter]: https://github.com/cybozu/yrmcds/blob/master/docs/counter.md\r\n[LZ4]: https://github.com/Cyan4973/lz4\r\n[2bsd]: https://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-2-Clause",
